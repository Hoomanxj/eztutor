after running the following query we can get the avg for each factor (energy, danceability and valence):
SELECT avg(energy), avg(danceability), avg(valence) FROM songs;
result:
avg energy       = 0.066
avg danceability = 0.072
avg valence      = 0.49

Looking at the values we might conclude that users mostly prefered songs with minimal energt value and danceability.
On the other hand, the songs have a partial neutrality in happy/sad scale (valence) with the value of 0.49.
This could mean that users prefer songs that are relaxing in nature and don't pay much attention to the content or lyrics
to see whether it is a happy or sad song.

Possible imporvement:

1- Adding the speechiness can shine some light on the fact that when do users listen to the songs to have a better understanding
    of their mood. For instance, the avg speechiness is 0.53 where it shows the users prefer a balanced combination of words in song
    and music. Now in a scenario that this value is lower, it might suggest that the users are listening to more instrumental-based
    tracks while they might be engaged in focuced-based tasks.
2- Adding the loudness in combination with the level of energy and danceability can show the intensity of feelings (sadness/happiness)
    while the users are listening to songs. Here, the avg value is -5.68 which shows a high level of loudness that can be interpreted
    as intese levels of emotions while listening to songs.
